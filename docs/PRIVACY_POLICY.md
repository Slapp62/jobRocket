### AI Processing Data

**What we collect:**
- Text extracted from job seeker profiles (job title, skills, professional summary)
- Text from job listings (title, description, requirements)

**Why we collect it:**
- Generate AI-powered job match scores (this is a core feature of JobRocket)
- Recommend relevant jobs to job seekers
- Help employers find qualified candidates

**Legal basis:** Contractual necessity - AI matching is integral to how JobRocket works

**Mandatory:** Yes - AI matching is required to use JobRocket as a job seeker

**Can I opt out?** No - AI job matching is a fundamental feature of our platform, not an optional add-on. Without it, we cannot provide you with personalized job recommendations or match scores. If you prefer not to use AI-powered matching, you may want to consider other job platforms.

**How long we keep it:** AI embeddings are deleted when you delete your account

**Who processes it:** OpenAI (US-based service). We send only profile text - never your name, email, or phone number.

---

### Job Application Data

**What we collect when you apply through JobRocket's internal system:**
- Your name, email, phone number (if provided)
- Your resume file
- Your cover letter/message (optional)
- Application timestamp
- Application status (pending, reviewed, rejected)
- The job and company you applied to

**Why we collect it:**
- Store your application for the employer to review
- Allow employers to manage and track applications
- Allow you to track your application history

**Legal basis:** Your consent (the checkbox you check when applying)

**Mandatory:** Yes - you must consent to share this data to apply through our internal system

**How long we keep it:**
- Until you delete the application (only while status is "pending"), OR
- Until the employer deletes the application, OR
- 2 years after the job closes (whichever comes first)

**Who can access it:**
- You (in your Applications page)
- The employer (in their dashboard on JobRocket)

**About deletion rights:**

Once you submit an application, you can delete it from our system **only while it's in "pending" status** (the employer hasn't reviewed it yet). Once an employer marks your application as "reviewed" or "rejected," you can no longer delete it from our system. This is because:
- The employer has invested time reviewing your application
- The employer needs records for their hiring process and legal compliance
- The application becomes part of the employer's business records

The employer can delete your application at any time, and we automatically delete all applications 2 years after the job closes.

If you want an employer to delete your reviewed application, contact them directly through the contact information on the job listing.

---

**What happens with email and external applications:**

When you apply via email or external link, JobRocket does not store your application data. The employer receives your information directly, and we have no record of it. In these cases:
- We cannot help you delete the application (contact the employer directly)
- We cannot track your application status
- The employer is independently responsible for handling your data according to privacy laws

---

### Technical and Security Data

**What we collect automatically:**
- IP address
- Browser type and version (user-agent)
- Login timestamps
- Session information

**Why we collect it:**
- Prove you consented to data processing (regulatory requirement)
- Prevent fraud and unauthorized access
- Secure your account

**Legal basis:** Legal obligation (proving consent) and legitimate interest (security)

**Mandatory:** Automatic

**How long we keep it:**
- Consent records: Permanently (legal requirement)
- Security logs: 90 days

---

### What We DON'T Collect

We do not use cookies for tracking or analytics. We do not collect sensitive data such as race, religion, political opinions, health information, or financial data.

---

## 3. Who Receives Your Data (Third Parties)

Your data may be shared with or processed by the following third parties:

### Cloudinary (United States)

**What they receive:** Resume files (PDF documents)

**Why:** We use Cloudinary to securely store and deliver resume files. When you upload a resume, it's stored on Cloudinary's servers.

**Their role:** Data processor (they process data on our behalf according to our instructions)

**Safeguards:** Cloudinary is contractually required to protect your data and cannot use it for their own purposes. Data is transmitted via encrypted connections.

**Your control:** Resume files are deleted from Cloudinary when you delete your application or account.

---

### OpenAI (United States)

**What they receive:** Text extracted from your profile (job title, skills, professional summary) and job listing descriptions

**What they DON'T receive:** Your name, email, phone number, or resume file

**Why:** We use OpenAI's API to generate AI embeddings that power our job matching algorithm. These embeddings are mathematical representations of your skills and experience.

**Their role:** Data processor (they process data on our behalf according to our instructions)

**Safeguards:**
- OpenAI is contractually prohibited from using your data to train their models
- We only send minimal text data necessary for matching
- Data is transmitted via encrypted connections

**Your control:** AI embeddings are deleted from our system when you delete your account. OpenAI retains API data for 30 days for abuse monitoring, then deletes it.

---

### Employers (Israel and potentially international)

**What they receive when you apply through our internal system:**
- Your name, email, phone (if provided)
- Your resume file
- Your cover letter/message
- Your match score

**Why:** To evaluate your job application

**Their role:** Independent data controller (they become responsible for your data once they receive it)

**Important:** Once an employer receives your application through JobRocket's internal system, they become independently responsible for handling your data according to privacy laws. We cannot control what they do with your application after you submit it. If you want an employer to delete your application data, contact them directly.

**For email and external applications:** We never transfer your data to employers - you send it directly to them, and they are solely responsible for it from the start.

---

### Render (United States)

**What they receive:** All data stored on our platform (they host our database and application servers)

**Why:** Render provides our hosting infrastructure - the servers that run JobRocket

**Their role:** Infrastructure provider / data processor

**Safeguards:**
- Render is contractually required to maintain security measures
- Data is stored on encrypted servers
- Access is restricted to essential operations only

**Your control:** Data is deleted from Render's servers when deleted from our system

---

### Contact Form Submissions (Your Email Provider)

**What they receive:** When you use our contact form on the About Us page, your message and email address are sent via email

**Why:** To allow us to respond to your inquiry

**Their role:** This uses standard email transmission - your email provider and our email provider both process the message

**Important:** Contact form messages are not stored in our database. They are sent as regular emails and subject to standard email privacy practices.

---

### International Data Transfers

Some of the third parties listed above are based in the United States, which does not have an "adequacy decision" from Israeli privacy authorities (meaning U.S. privacy laws are considered less protective than Israeli law).

**How we protect international transfers:**
- All third parties are contractually bound to protect your data according to Israeli privacy standards
- Data is transmitted using encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS)
- We minimize the data sent (e.g., OpenAI never receives identifying information)
- You explicitly consented to these transfers when you registered

**Your rights:** You can delete your account at any time, which will trigger deletion of your data from all third-party processors.

---

## 4. Your Privacy Rights

Under Israeli privacy law (Amendment 13), you have the following rights regarding your personal data:

### Right to Access Your Data

**What it means:** You can request a copy of all personal data we hold about you.

**How to exercise it:**
- Go to Settings > Privacy > Download My Data
- Or email us at support@jobrocket.work

**What you'll receive:** A JSON file containing all your profile information, application history, and account data. We'll provide this within 30 days of your request.

---

### Right to Correct Your Data

**What it means:** You can update or correct inaccurate information in your profile.

**How to exercise it:**
- Go to Settings > Profile to update your information
- For corrections we cannot provide through the interface, email support@jobrocket.work

**Response time:** Profile updates take effect immediately. Email requests are handled within 30 days.

---

### Right to Delete Your Data

**What it means:** You can request deletion of your account and personal data.

**How to exercise it:**
- Go to Settings > Account > Delete Account
- Or email us at support@jobrocket.work

**What gets deleted:**
- Your account and profile information
- Your resume files (from Cloudinary)
- Your AI embeddings (from our system and OpenAI's cache after 30 days)
- Your applications (subject to limitations below)

**Important limitations:**
- **Pending applications:** You can delete these at any time
- **Reviewed/rejected applications:** You cannot delete these from our system. Once an employer has reviewed your application, it becomes part of their business records. Contact the employer directly if you want them to delete it.
- **Consent records:** We must keep records showing that you consented to data processing (timestamps, IP addresses) permanently for legal compliance. These records do not include your profile data, only proof that consent was obtained.

**Timeline:** Account deletion is completed within 30 days. Resume files are deleted immediately from Cloudinary.

---

### Right to Object to AI Processing

**What it means:** Normally, you could object to certain types of data processing.

**JobRocket's position:** AI-powered job matching is a core feature of our platform, not an optional add-on. Without AI processing, we cannot provide you with personalized job recommendations or match scores.

**Your options:**
- You cannot opt out of AI processing while maintaining an active account
- You can delete your account at any time if you don't want AI processing

**Why AI is mandatory:** JobRocket is built around AI-powered matching. Opting out of AI would be like using Spotify without music recommendations - the platform wouldn't function as designed.

---

### Right to Data Portability

**What it means:** You can receive your data in a structured, commonly used format that you can transfer to another service.

**How to exercise it:**
- Go to Settings > Privacy > Download My Data
- Your data will be provided in JSON format, which can be read by most software

**What's included:** Your profile information, skills, work history, and application history.

---

### Right to Withdraw Consent

**What it means:** You can withdraw consent for processing that's based on consent (not contractual necessity).

**How to exercise it:**
- To withdraw consent for all processing: Delete your account (Settings > Account > Delete Account)
- Note: You cannot withdraw consent for essential services (account management, authentication) while keeping your account active, because we need your consent to provide the service

**Effect:** Withdrawing consent by deleting your account triggers deletion of all your data as described in "Right to Delete Your Data" above.

---

### Right to Lodge a Complaint

**What it means:** If you believe we've violated your privacy rights, you can file a complaint with the Israeli Privacy Protection Authority.

**How to complain:**

**Israel Privacy Protection Authority:**
- Website: gov.il/he/departments/the_privacy_protection_authority
- Phone: Check official website for current contact information
- Address: Ministry of Justice, 29 Salah a-Din Street, Jerusalem

**Before filing a complaint:** We encourage you to contact us first at support@jobrocket.work. We take privacy concerns seriously and will work to resolve any issues.

---

### Important Notes About Your Rights

**Response time:** We respond to all privacy rights requests within 30 days. If we need more time, we'll notify you.

**Verification:** To protect your privacy, we may ask you to verify your identity before fulfilling certain requests (especially data access or deletion requests).

**No charge:** Exercising your privacy rights is free. We don't charge fees for access, correction, or deletion requests.

**Limitations:** Some rights may be limited by law. For example, we must retain certain records for legal compliance even if you request deletion.

---

## 5. How We Protect Your Data

We take the security of your personal data seriously and implement multiple layers of protection:

### Technical Security Measures

**Encrypted connections:** All data transmitted between your browser and our servers uses HTTPS/TLS encryption. This means your data is protected from interception during transmission.

**Password security:** Your password is never stored in plain text. We use bcrypt hashing, an industry-standard method that converts your password into an irreversible encrypted form. Even our administrators cannot see your actual password.

**Secure file storage:** Resume files are stored on Cloudinary's secure infrastructure with restricted access controls. Files are only accessible through authenticated requests.

**Session management:** Your login sessions use secure, HTTP-only cookies that cannot be accessed by malicious scripts. Sessions automatically expire after a period of inactivity.

**Database security:** Our database is hosted on encrypted servers with restricted network access. Only essential systems can communicate with the database.

---

### Access Controls

**Principle of least privilege:** Our systems are configured so that each component can only access the specific data it needs to function. No single person or system has unrestricted access to all data.

**Role-based access:**
- Job seekers can only access their own profile and applications
- Employers can only access applications submitted to their job listings
- We maintain audit logs of who accessed what data and when

**Employee access:** Our team has minimal access to user data. Access is only granted when necessary for technical support or security purposes, and all access is logged.

---

### Organizational Measures

**Regular security reviews:** We periodically review our security practices and update them as needed to address new threats.

**Third-party security:** We only work with third-party services (Cloudinary, OpenAI, Render) that maintain strong security standards and are contractually obligated to protect your data.

**Incident response:** We have procedures in place to detect, respond to, and report security incidents. If a data breach occurs that poses a risk to your rights, we'll notify you and the Privacy Protection Authority within 72 hours.

**Data minimization:** We only collect and retain data that's necessary for our services. We don't collect sensitive data categories like health information, political opinions, or religious beliefs.

---

### What We Cannot Guarantee

**No system is 100% secure:** Despite our best efforts, no internet-based system can guarantee absolute security. Cyber threats constantly evolve, and determined attackers may find vulnerabilities.

**Your responsibility:**
- Keep your password confidential and don't share it with others
- Use a strong, unique password for your JobRocket account
- Log out from shared or public computers
- Report any suspicious activity to support@jobrocket.work immediately

**Third-party security:** Once your data is transferred to employers (via application) or third-party services, their security practices apply. We choose reputable partners, but we cannot control their security measures.

---

### Security Incident Reporting

If you notice any security issues or suspicious activity:
- Email us immediately at support@jobrocket.work
- Describe what you observed
- We'll investigate and take appropriate action

If we discover a data breach that affects your personal data, we'll notify you via email within 72 hours and explain:
- What data was affected
- What we're doing to address the breach
- Steps you can take to protect yourself

---

## 6. How Long We Keep Your Data

We only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to provide our services and comply with legal obligations.

### Active Accounts

**Your profile data:** Kept until you delete your account

**Your resume files:** Kept until you delete your account or the specific application that uses the resume

**Your AI embeddings:** Kept until you delete your account

**Your application history:** Kept until you delete the specific application (if pending), the employer deletes it, or 2 years after the job closes—whichever comes first

---

### After Account Deletion

**30-day grace period:** When you delete your account, we retain your data for 30 days in case you change your mind. During this period, you can contact support@jobrocket.work to restore your account.

**Permanent deletion:** After 30 days, we permanently delete:
- Your profile information
- Your resume files (from Cloudinary)
- Your AI embeddings
- Your pending applications

**What we keep permanently:**
- Consent records (timestamps, IP addresses showing when you agreed to data processing) - required by law to prove we obtained proper consent
- Basic account metadata needed for legal compliance (e.g., if there's a legal dispute)

---

### Application Data Retention

**Internal system applications:**
- **Pending applications:** Until you delete them, employer deletes them, or 2 years after job closes
- **Reviewed/rejected applications:** Until employer deletes them or 2 years after job closes (you cannot delete these)
- **Automatic deletion:** All applications are automatically deleted 2 years after the job listing closes, regardless of status

**Email and external applications:** We don't store these, so there's nothing to delete

---

### Technical and Security Data

**Security logs:** IP addresses, login timestamps, and security-related events are kept for 90 days, then automatically deleted

**Consent audit trail:** Timestamps and IP addresses showing when you consented to data processing are kept permanently for legal compliance

**Session data:** Temporary session information is deleted when you log out or after 24 hours of inactivity

---

### Employer-Related Data

**Job listings:** Kept until the employer deletes them or 2 years after the expiration date, whichever comes first

**Applications received:** Employers can delete applications at any time. We automatically delete all applications 2 years after the job closes.

---

### Why We Keep Data After Deletion

**Legal compliance:** Israeli law requires us to retain certain records (like consent records) to prove we followed privacy laws if authorities audit us.

**Security and fraud prevention:** Brief retention of security logs helps us detect and prevent abuse of our platform.

**Dispute resolution:** If there's a legal dispute (e.g., about a job application), we may need to retain relevant data until the dispute is resolved.

---

### Your Control Over Retention

**You can:**
- Delete your account anytime (triggers deletion after 30 days)
- Delete pending applications immediately
- Request data deletion by emailing support@jobrocket.work

**You cannot:**
- Delete reviewed/rejected applications (contact employer directly)
- Delete consent records (required by law)
- Force immediate deletion without the 30-day grace period (this protects against account hijacking)

---

## 7. Cookies and Tracking

We currently use minimal cookies and do not track your browsing behavior.

### Cookies We Use

**Essential cookies only:** We only use cookies that are strictly necessary for the platform to function:

**Session cookie:** Keeps you logged in as you navigate the site. This cookie is deleted when you log out or close your browser.

**CSRF protection token:** Prevents malicious websites from impersonating you. This is a security measure, not tracking.

**These cookies are essential and cannot be disabled.** Without them, you couldn't use JobRocket.

---

### What We Don't Use

**No analytics cookies:** We don't currently use Google Analytics or similar services to track how you use the site.

**No advertising cookies:** We don't use cookies for advertising or marketing purposes.

**No third-party tracking:** We don't allow third parties to place tracking cookies on our site.

---

### Future Changes

We may add analytics cookies in the future to understand how people use JobRocket and improve the platform. If we do, we'll update this Privacy Policy and provide you with the option to opt out of non-essential cookies.

---

### Your Browser Controls

You can disable cookies in your browser settings, but this will prevent you from logging in and using JobRocket.

---

## 8. Children's Privacy

JobRocket is not intended for children under the age of 18.

**We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 18 years old.** By using JobRocket, you confirm that you are at least 18 years old.

**If we discover that we've collected data from someone under 18:**
- We will delete that account and all associated data immediately
- We will notify the account holder that their account has been removed

**If you're a parent or guardian** and believe your child has created an account on JobRocket, please contact us immediately at support@jobrocket.work and we'll delete the account.

**Why this policy exists:** Employment services involve contracts and legal agreements that require adult consent. Job seeking and hiring are adult activities under Israeli law.

---
